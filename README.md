# Coding and Practice Problems 

This is a collection of coding and practice problems as a part of my journey to practice, refine, and improve my programming skills. 

## Patterns for Solving Coding Problems 

The following is a list of patterns common to solving coding problems.

### Two Pointers 
This is a common useful for removing duplicates 

### Fast and Slow Pointers 
Find a cycle in a linked list 

### Merge Intervals 
Conflicting appointments 

### Bread First Search 
Binary tree level order traversal 

### Depth First Search 
Find a path with given sequence 

### Subsets 
Permutations 

### Top "K" Elements 
Find the kth smallest number

### Dynamic Programming 
This is a good pattern for knapsack problem
